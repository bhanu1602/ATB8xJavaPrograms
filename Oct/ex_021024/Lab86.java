    Notes:

    - **Class**:
      - A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
      - It consists of fields (attributes) and methods (behavior).
      - No memory is allocated when a class is declared; memory is allocated only when an object of that class is instantiated.

    - **Attributes (Fields/Instance Variables)**:
      - Attributes represent the state or properties of a class.
      - These are typically member variables (or instance variables), such as `name`, `age`, etc.
      - Each object created from the class has its own copy of these attributes.

    - **Behavior (Methods)**:
      - Behavior defines what actions an object can perform.
      - Methods (also called member methods or instance methods) implement the behavior of the class.
      - Methods can be used to manipulate the object's data or perform other actions.

    - **Static Methods**:
      - Static methods belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class.
      - They can be called without creating an object of the class.
      - Example: The `main` method is static, so it can be executed without creating an instance of `Lab86`.

    - **Object**:
      - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a concrete entity created from the class blueprint.
      - Memory is allocated when an object is created using the `new` keyword.

    - **Class Structure**:
      1. **Attributes** (Fields/Instance Variables):
         - These are variables defined in a class to hold the state of an object.
         - Example: A class `Car` might have attributes like `color`, `model`, `year`.

      2. **Methods** (Instance Methods):
         - Methods define the behavior of a class.
         - Example: A `Car` class might have methods like `start()`, `stop()`, `accelerate()`.

    - **Inner Classes**:
      - A class defined within another class is known as an inner class.
      - Inner classes can be useful for logically grouping classes that will only be used in one place.

    - **Attributes vs. Behavior**:
      - **Attributes** (fields) represent the properties of an object.
      - **Behavior** (methods) represent the actions an object can perform.
