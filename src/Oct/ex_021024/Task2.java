OOPs - Object-Oriented Programming:
- OOP is a programming paradigm where the program is structured around objects rather than actions, and data is managed rather than logic.

Main Goals of OOP:
- The primary aim of OOP is to **bind data** and the **functions** that operate on the data within the same structure (i.e., objects).
- It promotes **data encapsulation**, meaning the internal representation of an object can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces (methods), keeping the rest hidden.

Key Features of OOP:

1. **Class**:
   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on the data.
   - A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.
   - Syntax:
     ```java
     class ClassName {
         // Fields (variables)
         // Methods (functions)
     }
     ```

2. **Object**:
   - An object is an instance of a class.
   - Each object has its own state (data) and behavior (methods).
   - Objects interact with one another by calling methods, thus allowing data exchange and functionality.
   - Syntax:
     ```java
     ClassName obj = new ClassName(); // Object creation
     ```

3. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstraction is the concept of **hiding the complex implementation details** and showing only the essential features of the object.
   - It simplifies complex systems by modeling classes at a higher level.
   - Example: When you use a car, you only interact with the steering wheel and pedals, without needing to know how the engine works.

4. **Encapsulation**:
   - Encapsulation is the technique of **wrapping data (variables)** and **methods** into a single unit (class).
   - It restricts direct access to some components of an object, thereby securing the objectâ€™s state and ensuring data integrity.
   - Access modifiers (like `private`, `public`) control access to the members of the class.

5. **Polymorphism**:
   - Polymorphism allows one **interface** to be used for different data types or classes.
   - There are two types:
     1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: Same method name but different parameters.
     2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: Same method signature, but the method behaves differently in different objects (inherited classes).

   - Example of Overloading:
     ```java
     class Demo {
         void add(int a, int b) { }
         void add(double a, double b) { } // Method overloading
     }
     ```

6. **Inheritance**:
   - Inheritance allows one class (child class) to **inherit fields and methods** from another class (parent class).
   - It promotes code reuse and a hierarchical class structure.
   - Syntax:
     ```java
     class Parent { }
     class Child extends Parent { } // Child inherits from Parent
     ```

7. **Dynamic Binding**:
   - The method that is to be executed is **decided at runtime** rather than compile time. This is common in method overriding where the method of the child class is called dynamically at runtime.

8. **Message Passing**:
   - Objects communicate with one another using **method calls**, and this exchange of information is termed message passing. It allows for dynamic behavior and interaction among objects.

Why OOP is Important:
- **Modularity**: OOP allows you to break down large programs into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Reusability**: Classes and objects can be reused across programs, reducing redundancy.
- **Maintenance**: It simplifies the maintenance of large codebases by promoting clean, well-structured code.
- **Security**: Through encapsulation, OOP secures data by controlling access and modifying permissions.
